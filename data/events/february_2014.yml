    topic: "Full Metal Rüby <br />Behind the scenes of tech communities"
    bio: |
      Florian Gilcher fell in love with Ruby before Rails was even a thing.
      Today, he runs a consultancy focussing on special backend systems —
      in Ruby and other languages.

      He is involved in the Ruby community though the charity Ruby Berlin e.V.,
      co-organizing eurucamp, JRubyConf.EU and several other meetups.
      His relationship with Finland is a painful one.

  - handle: vesa
    name: Vesa Vänskä
    title: Senior Software Developer at Kisko
    topic: "Hypermedia APIs <br />Why, what, how?"
    bio: |
      Vesa has been involved with the Ruby fad for seven years. He has had
      time to get mixed up with a lot of things. He is partner at Kisko Labs,
      web product consultancy based in Helsinki. At Kisko he also builds
      the best workout journal app WODconnect, organizes Helsinki Ruby
      Brigade meet-ups and Frozen Rails conference. As a member of Rails Girls
      team he helps people take their first steps in the world of programming.
      When he is not doing all that stuff he is probably drinking coffee,
      playing games and listening to music with bass.
